# QA Automation Portfolio

This repository showcases my QA automation frameworks and test plans for network and embedded systems, developed for roles at Apple, Fortinet, Google, Tesla, and Cisco. It includes Python and TCL/Expect scripts for test automation and detailed test plans for feature validation.

## Structure
- **test_plans/**: Test plans for iOS Photos, FortiGate firewalls, Google Cloud VPC, Tesla firmware, and Webex VoIP.
- **scripts/python/**: Python scripts for automated testing (e.g., iCloud sync, BGP validation).
- **scripts/tcl/**: TCL/Expect scripts for CLI-based testing (e.g., FortiOS, Cisco routers).
- **docs/**: Setup instructions and tool requirements.

## Highlights
- Reduced QA time by 30% at UTStarcom with Python automation.
- Improved VoIP reliability by 20% at Cisco with TCL/Expect.
